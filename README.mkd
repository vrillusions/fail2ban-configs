# fail2ban configs

These are various customizations I've done to fail2ban.

## Usage

```
mkdir /srv/fail2ban-local
cd /srv/fail2ban-local
git clone https://github.com/vrillusions/fail2ban-configs.git .
ln -s /srv/fail2ban-local/jail.local /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
...
```

One of these days I'll get around to automating that last step since it leaves room for error

## Future

Instead of having just the local modifications, version control the entire thing
